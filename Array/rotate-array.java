/*Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Solution:*/

class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        
        k = k % nums.length;
    int count = 0;
    for (int start = 0; count < nums.length; start++) {
      int current = start;
      int prev = nums[start];
      do {
        int next = (current + k) % nums.length;
        int temp = nums[next];
        nums[next] = prev;
        prev = temp;
        current = next;
        count++;
      } while (start != current);
    }
}
}
